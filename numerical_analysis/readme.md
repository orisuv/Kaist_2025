This project implements Finite Difference Method (FDM)-based numerical pricing models for derivatives. It provides:

American Options (1D PDE) using a Crank–Nicolson scheme with PSOR to handle early exercise constraints

Worst-of Binary Options (2D PDE) using both One-Step Method (OSM) and Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) schemes

Both implementations compute not only option prices but also key Greeks, offering a practical framework for studying PDE-based derivatives pricing and numerical stability.
