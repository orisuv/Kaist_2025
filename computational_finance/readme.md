Project Overview

This project develops deep learning–based models to forecast S&P 500 realized volatility with high accuracy. Using daily SPX data, realized volatility is computed as a 22-day rolling standard deviation, and three LSTM-based models are compared: (1) a baseline LSTM using price returns and lagged realized volatility, (2) an LSTM-GARCH model incorporating GARCH(2,2) conditional volatility forecasts, and (3) a Hybrid model additionally integrating VIX implied volatility. Experimental results show that the simple LSTM model delivers the best predictive performance with the lowest MAE and RMSE, while adding GARCH or VIX information increases complexity without improving accuracy. The findings highlight that essential features such as returns and recent realized volatility already contain sufficient predictive information, and model simplicity enhances generalization in volatility forecasting.
